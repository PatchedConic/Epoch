# Epoch Based Document ID
## Concept
Engineering documents and artifacts are typically controlled using reference IDs such as drawing numbers, part numbers, and serial numbers. Non-significant ID's are typically recorded sequentially with their use noted in a central register. A method and reference implementation is presented here for generating engineering ID's that are unique without requiring a central registry to maintain cognizance of which ID's have been issued and which are available. 

The method uses a central issuing authority to generate an ID that is composed of two parts: an encoded time stamp, and a check digit. Their concatination produces the final ID

### Time stamp
The bulk of the ID string is generated by counting the number of time intervals since a particular epoch. In the accompanying reference implementation, the epoch is given as February 13th, 2025 at midnight UTC. 

#### Time Intervals
The choice of time intervals is largely subject to human factors. Research has indicated that drawing and part numbers should generally be no longer than 7 to 9 characters long in order to reduce human error during recall and transcription. 

Encoding will be discussed in the next section, however take it as a given that we will encode the time stamp in base 34. If we assume that one digit is reserved as a check digit, the table below shows how long it will take for the ID's to overflow depending on the time interval. 

| Time Interval | 7 Digit | 8 Digit | 9 Digit |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0.001 Sec | xys | sdjf | fkd |
| 0.01 Sec |
